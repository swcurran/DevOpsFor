# What is DevOps?

--

DevOps (a clipped compound of "software DEVelopment" and "information technology OPerationS") is a term used to refer to a set of practices that emphasize the collaboration and communication of both software developers and information technology (IT) professionals while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes. It aims at establishing a culture and environment where building, testing, and releasing software can happen rapidly, frequently, and more reliably. .red.bold[*]

.footnote[.red.bold[*] Wikipedia]

###Are we done here?

???
DevOps - not a straight forward "product"/"thing"
* First use - Name of a conference presentation
* Cultural component - improving communications and shared goals
* Lean component - continuous improvement
* Automation and tools

So lets hold off on "What is it" and go to...

---

# Why is DevOps?
### Roots - merging Developers and Operations work

.left-column[
* Devs - provide the code
   * User Interface (UI/UX)
   * Business Logic/Rules
   * Integrations
   * Database (usually)

Prepare applications for production.
]
--

.right-column[
* Ops - run the code
   * Servers
   * Networks
   * Databases
   * Security

Operate applications in production.
]

???
NOTE: DevOps is Development Methodology agnostic, but Agile requires DevOps.

# Backup a bit - what's an app?
.left-column[<img style="height:110%;"  src="images/webarchitecture.png" alt="Web Architecture">]
--
.right-column[

## Examples
* COTS
* .NET + front end + database
* Java + front end + database
* MEAN (Mongo Express Angular Node)
* Django (Python + front end + database)
* Front End: Bootstrap, React, Backbone, Angular, etc.
* Database: Postgres, SQL Server, Oracle, Mongo

## Ops View

* Networking zones
* URLs - _https://myapp.gov.bc.ca_
* Authentication - e.g. siteminder
* Encryption - SSL

#Dev and Ops: Making it Work - In Theory

<img src="images/sdlc_waterfall_model.jpg" alt="Waterfall Design" width="65%" >

Meetings, documents, agreements and requests

???

Note - this is just like software development/test

But this is just about deployment

In government - sometimes not obvious to the developers that this needs to be done

# However: What Ginger Hears...

--

.right-column[<img src="images/WhatOpsSee.png" alt="What Ops See" width="92%" >]

???

Not Surprising and no one's fault

* Devs - 100% of functionality, end user requirements, changes
* Ops - 100 other apps to manage, production issues
* It's not obvious what's needed
* It's really hard to get budget if you can define exactly the benefit

# Deployment
### The rubber hits the road and...

--

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...up pops *_The Wall of Confusion_*

.center[<img src="images/overthewall.png" alt="Over the Wall of Confusion" height="350" >]

---

# What goes wrong?
### Ineffective Communications

Communication is via Word documents - the dreaded .red[_Release Guide_]

* Premise: To deploy this app, do this...and this...and this...then this...
* Assumption: The writer knows the reader's world...impossible

--

###Impact:

* Steps are performed manually
* On-the-fly compensations are made...further invalidating the assumption
  * On Dev, Test and Prod

???

* Example - doing home PC support - remotely
* Example - assume a piece of software is present - missing, so add it on Test.

---

# What goes wrong?
###Inconsistent Environments

* Developers develop in their world, deliver to a different one
   * Each Dev creates their own development/test capability
      * Execution environment doesn't match production
      * Minimal test data
   * Periodically delivers code - usually at a milestone - e.g. UAT
     * Agile _should_ fix that
   * Test data doesn't match production

--

###Impact:

* It works on my machine!

???

* On first delivery try - may or may not work

* Performance must be acceptable
   * But volume of data not considered
   * Options:
      * Get the data
      * Other mitigation strategies

---

# What goes wrong?
### Unnecessary Dependencies

* Inappropriate optimizations
   * Procurement/funding optimizations: time and cost
   * Enterprise solutions: Hammers and nails
* Architectural approaches
   * Monolith apps

--

###Impact:

* Unexpected impacts on apps
 * Updates to one app breaks an unrelated app
* Cross-app coordination
 * Updates to one app causes an outage to another app
 * The Release Party: multiple LOBs involved in a release

???
Whys:

* Because other team not available
* Because unexpected impact
* Solution: Look for impacts, involve other teams in releases
* Because unexpected dependencies
* Solution: Eliminate dependencies
---

# All of which leads to...


--
# Release Days

.center[<img src="images/dayafter.jpg" alt="The Day After" width="75%" >]

.footnote[Credit: Twentieth Century Fox - _The Day After_]
???

* Users can't log in
* Performance is terrible
* A feature no longer works
* Bugs occur
* Non-Functional Requirements
    * Performance
    * Monitoring
    * Logging
    * Capacity

A day - or several - fixing things

???

* Often the issues are minor and easily fixed
* Rare that something unexpected and huge hits
---
# The Reflex Response

* We *almost* did it right, we just need to do it .red[*better*] next time
* Test more - take our time, check _EVERYTHING_
--

* For now, though... .red.bold[DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING!!]
--

* Except - demand builds from **_everywhere_** for fixes/capabilities

--

<img src="images/WallOfConfusionChange.png" alt="The Wall of Confusion - Change" width="45%" >

???

* Checklists are really popular for this
* The checklists grow continuously as more scenarios are found

???
class: center, middle

That's the problem - one team creates, one team operates and there is friction in the middle

And in solving that - we'll discover even more benefits

# The First Way: Flow (Systems Thinking)

* Purpose of the system: Flow of Value
  * Manufacturing: Optimize inputs to outputs

--

<img src="images/First_Way_Flow.png" alt="The First Way: Flow" width="40%" >

--

* End to End Thinking - .bold[*Lean*]
 * Global, not local, optimizations
 * Prevent defects from flowing
 * Identify and eliminate bottlenecks
     * **_Spoiler Alert_**: Manual processes tend to be defect and bottleneck sources...
 * Enable a "Roll-forward" mindset

???

 Business value - nothing until product is released
 System end to end requires a cross-functional team
 Eliminating defects also means eliminating human steps

---

# The First Way: Flow (Systems Thinking)

<img src="images/First_Way_Flow.png" alt="The First Way: Flow" width="40%" >

* Examples
  * Build, Test and Deployment Automation
  * Consistency across environments (Sandbox, Dev, Test, Prod)
  * Easy environment creation - servers, connectivity, databases, etc.

---

# The Second Way: Feedback

* For end to end improvement: Feedback
  * Communication across the team

--

<img src="images/Second_Way_Feedback.png" alt="The Second Way: Feedback" width="40%" >

--

* Enable Global Optimizations
  * Communicate all the issues - fix them together
  * Respond quickly, adjust processes
  * Empower contributors
  * Enable understanding of .bold[*Value*]
  * Normalize _The First Way_
---

## The Third Way:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continual Learning and Experimentation

* Theorize, Test, Evaluate - and repeat
  * Low risk, high return
  * Small batch sizes

--

<img src="images/Third_Way.png" alt="The Third Way: Continual Learning and Experimentation" width="35%" >

--

* Drive new business value
  * Faster feedback / Fast fail
  * More reliable processes
  * Better capabilities

???
* More components under control
* Testing framework makes it easy to automate testing - reduces risk
* Security becomes routine not an event
* A-B testing allows production experimentation

---

# Summary: DevOps - The Three Ways

* A cultural change
  * End to end thinking in the application of Lean
  * Feedback (visibility and communication) across the full team
  * Managed experiments - in the form of rapid, small deliveries

# Applying DevOps - Discussions

* Getting Started: Value Stream Mapping
* Organizational Structure
* Work Tracking and Organization
* Problem Management
* Integrating Operations into Daily Work

---

## Value Stream Mapping - The First Way

* Lean process
  * Define the bounds of the process - e.g "Adding a feature to a report"
  * Map the steps to go from inputs to delivered value - **end to end**
  * Categorize steps as adding value or not
  * Assess the quality of each step - rework generated, wait times
  * Measure the overall time for each step
  * Identify opportunities for improvement

* Key Metric: [Value Adding Time] / [Total Time]

   * "Must Have" releases - ready or not
   * Thrashing - jumping between features
* Poor quality software
   * Server errors, outages

--
.right-column[
* Approach:
  * Map the delivery process
  * Figure out what hurts the most
  * Stop that pain
  * Repeat


* Steps:
  * Build, deploy automation
  * Routine production releases
  * Shrink release intervals
  * Release only "ready" code
  * Test automation

  * Value delivered much faster
  * Product quality went way up

# Organizational Structure

#### When evaluating processes - be aware of Conway's Law

* Should the organizational structure change to improve the process?
* Should the architecture be match the organization to improve the process?
* What will be the transitional impact?

#### Goal: Avoid a mismatch of process and organization

* Consider this during the value stream mapping process

## Approaches to Testing: Traditional

<img src="images/traditional_v.png" alt="Traditional V Testing" width="59%" >

???

* Unit Testing
* Integration Testing
* Systems Integration Testing
* System Testing
* Acceptance Testing
* Operational Testing - does it work live?

---
## Approaches to Testing: _Shift Left_

<img src="images/Agile_DevOps_Shift_Left_Testing.jpg" alt="Shift Left - Agile and DevOps" width="80%" >

???

The first production deploy should NEVER be the day before go live!!!
Verification of standards - database, security, look and feel, etc., etc.

???

---
## Approaches to Testing: _Shift Left_

#### Iterative Process

* Release Pain Points
   * Ongoing problems
   * Too much effort to do manually - automate it


--

* Regression Test Frameworks - tests as a byproduct of "real" work
   * Unit Test Framework
   * API Test Framework
   * User Interface Test Framework

--


* Non-Functional Regression Test Frameworks
  * Load Test Framework
  * Security Test Framework

---
### Approaches to Testing: Production - Early and Often

--

* Regularly push builds out as far as possible
  * Controlled use on Production before go live
     * Evaluate risks and minimize
     * Example: Cutting off saving "real data"


--


* Benefits
   * Ops processes executed regularly #nodrama
   * Users see the data in THEIR context - not test data
      * Best understanding and best feedback

--


* Pre-Go Live testing of non-functional requirements
   * Real data in (controlled) production
   * Performance
   * Scalability

---

## Risk Mitigation: Many Small Releases

 <img src="images/ReleasePainSpiral.png" alt="Release pain spiral" width="35%" >

--


Big Release - Big Risk - many things to break - hard to fix<br>Small Release - Small Risk - only a few things to break - easy to fix

--

Advanced - Canary Testing running two versions at the same time - splitting users


???

* Spotify!!!

* This applies to Dev (every change), Test (regularly) and Prod (when Business wants)
* Planning out a release - all the things to include vs. Facebook releases
* ICM vs. CCD
* Launching of a Rocket vs. Driving to work - adapt

---
## Risk Mitigation: Many Small Releases

#### Eliminate production hacking

--

.left-column[<img src="images/lessthan30minutes.png" alt="Less than 30 minute releases" width="65%" >]

.right-column[

Fix Releases: done _properly_ - "Roll-forward"

1. **Issue found**
2. Issue documented - e.g. JIRA entered
3. **Issue investigated**
4. Issue fixed, checked in
5. Build / Deploy
6. Verify fix
7. Deploy to Test
8. Verify
9. Deploy To **Production**...phewwww!!!

]

???

Traditional approach - 1, 3, and fix in production

---

### Risk Mitigation: Aggressively Eliminate Dependencies

--

.right-column[<img src="images/DecoupledReleases.png" alt="Decoupled Releases" width="100%" >]
.left-column[]

--

Fake Dependencies

* Enterprise Release Scheduling - don't!!
* Eliminate artificial deadlines
* Dependencies on people
* Dependencies on products/licenses

--

Architectural Dependencies

* Isolate apps / parts of apps
   * Different servers ($$$)
   * Docker, etc.
* Don't share databases
   * But don't duplicate data - use APIs

---

## Security

#### Traditional Approach

* One time event for new deployments
   * Static analysis - Code scanning
   * Dynamic analysis - intrusion scanning
* Patching of infrastructure - OS, Hypervisor, Database etc.

--

#### Challenges

* Threats are ever evolving
   * Much like virus definitions
   * Occasional urgent updates
* Applications often contain many components
---

## Security

#### DevOps approaches

* Security in the Pipeline
   * As code changes, scanning performed

--


* Periodic Security Scans
   * As the definition of "vulnerability" evolves
   * E.g. daily even after app is "stable"


--

* Urgent deploys
   * Pipeline support for fast releases
      * Robust build, test, deploy and promote

---

## Logging/Monitoring

#### Traditional Approach

* Logging for Developers not Operations
   * Not useful to Ops

--


* Logging "Set and forget" in Production
   * Wait until it's needed

--


* Independent
   * Not correlated to events

--


* Monitoring - service status focus - Up/Down
   * With a pager...

--

#### Challenges

* Misses out on the Second Way - Feedback
* Outage detection but limited learning

---
## Logging/Monitoring (The Second Way)

#### DevOps approaches

* Collaboration in building logging
   * Data useful for Operations
     * Trends
     * Events - e.g. tracing
     * Dynamically adjusted
   * Formatted for automation - e.g. JSON vs. text

--


* Consolidated Logs - one place to go
   * Consistent formats
   * Coorelated events
   * Data Visualizations for all participants

--


* Monitoring response automation
   * Example: Kubernetes - automatic restarts
   * Example: Rundeck - "automated" Runbook - monitoring alert triggers script

---

## Documentation (* as Code)

#### Traditional Approach

* Parallel documentation to system
   * Difficult (impossible?) to keep in sync
* Worse...doesn't exist

--

#### Challenges

* Documentation is not accurate and so not trusted
   * Waste of effort
* Documentation is rigourously maintained to be accurate (rare)
   * Waste of effort

---

## Documentation (* as Code)

#### DevOps Approaches

* Documentation is (mostly) eliminated - converted to code
   * Infrastructure as code
   * Scripts
   * Deployment Pipeline
   * Still need higher level documents - just not the details


--

* Documentation is a process by-product
   * Linking Issue Tracking to Version Control
   * Generated from source code

# The Three Ways

* Flow
   * Focused on impacts to the _entire_ system

<img src="images/First_Way_Flow.png" alt="The First Way: Flow" width="20%" >


--

* Create Feedback Loops

<img src="images/Second_Way_Feedback.png" alt="The Second Way: Feedback" width="20%" >

--


* Continual Experimentation and Learning

<img src="images/Third_Way.png" alt="The Third Way: Continual Learning and Experimentation" width="17%" >

---

### Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, Sharing

--

.left-column[
### Anti-Patterns

* Siloed groups
* New day, same pain
* Little/no version control
* Other Environments not like Prod
* "Agile" but no DevOps
* Cross Project Release Schedules
* Release adventures: different every time
* Post-deployment fixes without release
* Endless release email chains
* Pet Servers that live forever
* Test Date = Start UAT Date - 1
* Production Date = Go Live Date - 1

]

--
.right-column[
### Patterns

* Collaboration on system-wide improvements
* Constant elimination of bottlenecks
* Version control for everything
* Other Environments ~= Prod
* Releases easy, getting easier
* Many, many, many releases -- shift left
* Early and often to test, prod
* Environments are cheap - recreatable
* Continuous feedback and notifications
* Aggressive elimination of dependencies

]

###What is DevOps?
* We learned:
   * A culture of applying Lean principles to the end-to-end system
     * Summarized in "The Three Ways"
         * Flow
         * Feedback
         * Continuous Learning and Experimentation
   * Reduce risk by addressing it as early as possible - "shift left"
   * Backed by lots of powerful tools - largely developed and shared in the open

---
###Proposal: Getting Started with DevOps

--

* Value Stream Mapping
--

* Work Tracking
--

* Regular Ceremonies around Work Tracking
--

* Critical Incident Reviews

--

## Foundation: Team-based Culture
